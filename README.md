##### A simple to-do app built with Electron, React, Redux, and LESS.

 React and Redux are solely used to implement the application logic. Electron, on the other hand, is used to implement both structure and application logic to create real cross-platform desktop apps. It is a wrapper which contains a chromium browser in a NodeJS environment. This technology enables the combination of pure web frontend technologies and additionally gives your application full access to the underlying operating system via NodeJS. In the following, we will introduce the basic concepts using a simple Electron app and show how this technology solves the everlasting single-threaded obstacle of non-responsive JavaScript applications.
